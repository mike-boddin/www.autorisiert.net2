## idea

based on this [blog-article](https://hackernoon.com/12-cool-things-you-can-do-with-github-f3e0424cf2f0) by david gilbertson

I just want to try, if I am capable to write a small website with some simple js, which uses Github as CMS :)

## webpack

first we need to configure webpack properly  
any tutorials out there? [try this?](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/04/learn-webpack-in-15-minutes)

Ok, good tutorial so far to start little and plain.
We need a [copy-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin) to move the `index.html` to the dist-folder.

What about [a dev-server?](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
